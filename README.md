# Entangled-In-Plastic

This project is a game based around the detrimental issue of plastic in our oceans and it's effect on marine life. The user controls a fish using the WASD keys as plastic spawns into the frame. It's the user's objective to dodge the plastic for as long as possible however as the timer goes on, the plastic moves quicker and there is greater frequency in which it spawns. Try to survive for as long as possible!
